shell waits for more input when we only type \\
heap buffer overflow when erasing a character (try with -fsanitize=address)
first token of split line is empty when command is a parenthesis

multiline quotes isn't working
try: echo "
hello
world
"

shell's acts like there is an unfinished double quote when there's a pipe at end of line
try: echo |
You can just return me {"echo", "|", NULL}, i should already handle the syntax error
Same for && or || at end of line.

single quotes multiline prompt is dquote>, it should be quote>
unfinished \ multiline prompt is also dquote>, bash --posix only prints >

CTRL-C can't delete the current line, i'll need a function that erases the current line to handle that
